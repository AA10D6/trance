Prerequisites:

- Visual Studio 2013 or newer
- CMake
- Mingw/MSYS
- YASM (download standalone exe for 32- or 64-bit Windows)

Trance can be built in Debug or Release mode, and Win32 or x64 platform.
Clone all the dependencies (run "git submodule update --init").
Build all the dependencies:

gflags
- Use CMake to generate project files using the "Visual Studio 12 2013" setting
  in a subfolder called "gflags\Win32".
- Use CMake to generate project files using the "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"
  setting in a subfolder called "gflags\x64".
- gflags should be built as a static library. This is the default.
- Build the libraries from the project files in the subfolders.

glew_1_10_0
- Has project files in glew_1_10_0\build\vc10.
- Upgrade these project files and build them.
- You might need to edit down the length of one string in glew.rc.

libovr_0_4_4
- Has project files in libovr_0_4_4\Projects\Win32\VS2013.

protobuf
- Has project files in protobuf\vsprojects.

libvpx
- Make subfolders "libvpx\Win32" and "libvpx\x64".
- From MSYS shell in libvpx\Win32 folder, run
  "../configure --target=x86-win32-vs12 && make".
- From MSYS shell in libvpx\x86 folder, run
  "../configure --target=x86_64-win64-vs12 && make".
- Copy yasm.exe into both subfolders ("libvpx\Win32" and "libvpx\x64").
- Build the libraries from project files in the subfolders.

libwebm
- Use CMake to generate project files using the "Visual Studio 12 2013" setting
  in a subfolder called "libwebm\Win32".
- Use CMake to generate project files using the "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"
  setting in a subfolder called "libwebm\x64".
- libwebm should be built as a static library. This is the default.
- Edit the generated project files, changing the "Runtime Library" option from
  "Multi-threaded" to "Multi-threaded DLL" (and "Multi-threaded Debug" to
  "Multi-threaded Debug DLL") in each project. This option is in
  "C++ -> Code Generation".
- Build the libraries from the project files in the subfolders.

sfml
- Use CMake to generate project files using the "Visual Studio 12 2013" setting
  in a subfolder called "sfml\Win32".
- Use CMake to generate project files using the "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"
  setting in a subfolder called "sfml\x64".
- sfml should be built as a dynamic library. This is the default.
- Build the libraries from the project files in the subfolders.

Everything should now be set up correctly and installed in the right place to
build Trance from project files in the root.
